    "In this notebook we demonstrate how the Globus Flows service can be used to automate data management at scale. We demonstrate a flow that automates a common design pattern: moving data from one system to another and making the data accessible to collaborators. This flow is often needed to manage data coming from instruments, e.g., image files can be moved from local storage attached to a microscope to a high-performance storage system where they may be accessed by all members of the research project.\n",

    "We will walk through the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Authenticate with Globus and get tokens for accessing various services\n",
    "1. Define and register a flow with Globus\n",
    "1. Execute a flow using configurable inputs for the endpoint and access permissions\n",

    "Access to the Flow service is already granted to you by virtue of authenticating to the JupyterHub running this notebook. Note: If you're running this notebook in your own environment you will need to manually log into Globus Auth and get tokens using a native app authorization flow (see the `Platform_Introduction_Native_App_Auth` notebook for an example of how to initiate this flow)."
