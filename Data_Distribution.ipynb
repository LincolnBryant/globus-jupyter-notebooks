    "\n",
    "1. A user has logged into the scinece gateway and wishes to access a dataset\n",
    "1. Once the user selects the dataset, the science gateway will stage the data in a temporary directory, and grant the user read-only access to the directory\n",
    "1. Once the user has successfully downloaded the data, the directory is removed (this can also be done based on a timeframe, after which the user's permission is revoked).\n",

    "1. You have established your identity by authenticating, with an institutional credential, ORCID, or similar\n",
    "1. You have granted consent to the issuance of tokens with certain scopes\n",
